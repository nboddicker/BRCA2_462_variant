# BRCA2_450_variant
Analyses for evaluation of BRCA2 missense variants

This repository contains description of methods and code used to generate results/figures for journal article titled: "Functional analysis and clinical classification of 462 germline BRCA2 DNA binding domain missense variants".

Two directories are available

Directory: HDR_Confidence_Intervals
  This directory contains input file and code to compute summaries by variant and estimate a hierarchical Bayesian model. The code is in Rmd format.

Directory: BRCA2_450_LR_Curves
